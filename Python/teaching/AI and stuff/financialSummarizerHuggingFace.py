# Some text to summarize here
text_to_summarize = """
National Commercial Bank (NCB), Saudi Arabia’s largest lender by assets, 
agreed to buy rival Samba Financial Group for $15 billion in the biggest banking takeover this year.
NCB will pay 28.45 riyals ($7.58) for each Samba share, according to a statement on Sunday, 
valuing it at about 55.7 billion riyals. 
NCB will offer 0.739 new shares for each Samba share, 
at the lower end of the 0.736-0.787 ratio the banks set when they signed an initial framework agreement in June.
The offer is a 3.5% premium to Samba’s Oct. 8 closing price of 27.50 riyals and about 24% higher than the level the shares traded at before the talks were made public. 
Bloomberg News first reported the merger discussions.
The new bank will have total assets of more than $220 billion, creating the Gulf region’s third-largest lender. 
The entity’s $46 billion market capitalization nearly matches that of Qatar National Bank QPSC, 
which is still the Middle East’s biggest lender with about $268 billion of assets.
